- [Groundwater Impacts of Water Consumption Patterns in Bengaluru, India. ](https://repository.iimb.ac.in/bitstream/2074/12010/1/Malghan_JGWR_2013_Vol.2_Iss.1.pdf)  While growing urban demand has the potential to significantly impact the water resources of distant sources, there is no doubt that it drastically modifies the local water balance. Despite this, very little research has emerged on the natural and modified water balance of urban areas in India. In this paper, taking Bangalore as a case study, the possible impacts of domestic water supply and consumption through lumped and distributed simulations of net groundwater recharge are illustrated
- [Traditional water bodies and urban resilience a historical perspective from Bengaluru](researchgate.net/publication/318181875) Resilience of a city is a measure of its ability to retain or adapt form and function in the possibility of change. This is particularly true of urban water security in a water scarce world. One component of urban water resilience is that provided by historical and traditional water sources such as lakes, ponds, and stepwells. Unfortunately, as cities lose dependence on these formerly important water bodies, they stand neglected and vulnerable to various threats. This paper makes a case for returning to historical reasons for use and disuse of these water bodies in order to conserve them in the contemporary period.

- [Anomaly Detection System for Water Networks in Northern Ethiopia Using Bayesian Inference](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/7/2897) To detect anomalies, a model for normal water usage is required first. A multilevel probabilistic model of normal usage is trained using approximate variational Bayesian inference to obtain a conditional probability distribution over the hourly water usage data. Then the conditional distribution is used to construct a level-1 scoring function for each hourly water observation and a level-2 scoring function. Probabilistic models and Bayesian inference collectively are chosen for their ability to capture the high temporal variability in the water usage data  as well as their ability to estimate interpretable model parameters.
